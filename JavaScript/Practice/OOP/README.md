OOP---

Object-Orientd Programming (OOP) is a programming language model / style organized around objects rather then 'action' and rather than logic

JavaScript---

JavaScript is not a versatile and dynamic programming language that supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, functional, and object oriented programming, while JavaScript is not a purely Object-Oriented language like Java or C++, it Provides the tools and features to implement OOP concepts effectively.

-----Yes, JavaScript is considered an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, but it has a unique approach compared to classical OOP languages like Java or C++.

In JavaScript, you can create objects and use prototypes to share properties and methods. It supports concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. With ES6, the introduction of the class syntax made it even easier to implement OOP principles, although it's still fundamentally prototype-based.

So, while JavaScript is not a traditional OOP language, it certainly supports object-oriented programming concepts effectively.

OOP In JS?

----OOP in JavaScript refers to the practice of designing and structuring code around objects and their ineractions. It is a Programming paradigm that allows developers to model real-world entities and their relationships using objects and classes.
