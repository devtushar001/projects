--Document Object Model

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

<!-- The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a critical concept in web development that allows JavaScript to interact with HTML and XML documents. Here's a detailed explanation of what the DOM is and how it works:

### What is the DOM?

- **Definition:** The DOM is a programming interface provided by browsers that represents the structure of a web document as a tree of objects. Each element in the document, such as tags, attributes, and text, is represented as a node in this tree.
- **Purpose:** It allows programming languages, like JavaScript, to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically. Through the DOM, scripts can read and update the document’s content, structure, and styles.

### How the DOM Works

1. **Document Structure:**
   - When a web page is loaded, the browser parses the HTML and constructs a DOM tree. This tree represents the document's structure, where each node corresponds to an HTML element, attribute, or piece of text.
   - The root of the DOM tree is the `document` object, which represents the entire web page.

2. **DOM Tree Nodes:**
   - **Element Nodes:** Represent HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`). Each element node has properties and methods for accessing and modifying its attributes and content.
   - **Attribute Nodes:** Represent the attributes of HTML elements (e.g., `href`, `class`). Attributes are part of their respective element nodes.
   - **Text Nodes:** Represent the text content inside HTML elements.

3. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - JavaScript can interact with the DOM using methods provided by the `document` object and its properties. This includes accessing elements, modifying their content, and responding to events.

### Common DOM Methods and Properties

- **Accessing Elements:**
  - `document.getElementById(id)`: Selects an element with a specific `id`.
  - `document.getElementsByClassName(className)`: Selects elements with a specific class.
  - `document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)`: Selects elements with a specific tag name.
  - `document.querySelector(selector)`: Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
  - `document.querySelectorAll(selector)`: Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

- **Manipulating Elements:**
  - `element.innerHTML`: Gets or sets the HTML content inside an element.
  - `element.textContent`: Gets or sets the text content inside an element.
  - `element.setAttribute(name, value)`: Sets the value of an attribute on an element.
  - `element.getAttribute(name)`: Gets the value of an attribute on an element.
  - `element.classList.add(className)`: Adds a class to an element’s list of classes.
  - `element.classList.remove(className)`: Removes a class from an element’s list of classes.

- **Creating and Appending Elements:**
  - `document.createElement(tagName)`: Creates a new element node.
  - `element.appendChild(newChild)`: Adds a new child element to a parent element.
  - `element.removeChild(child)`: Removes a child element from a parent element.

- **Events:**
  - `element.addEventListener(event, function)`: Attaches an event handler to an element.
  - `element.removeEventListener(event, function)`: Removes an event handler from an element.

### Example of DOM Manipulation

Here’s a basic example that demonstrates how to use JavaScript to interact with the DOM:

**HTML:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="header">Hello, World!</h1>
    <button id="changeText">Change Text</button>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**JavaScript (`script.js`):**
```javascript
document.getElementById('changeText').addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.getElementById('header').textContent = 'Text Changed!';
});
```

In this example:
- The `getElementById` method is used to access the button and header elements.
- An event listener is attached to the button to listen for click events.
- When the button is clicked, the `textContent` property of the header is updated.

### Summary

The DOM provides a structured representation of a web document and a way to interact with it programmatically. Understanding the DOM is essential for web development because it enables dynamic manipulation of web pages, allowing for interactive and responsive user experiences. -->
